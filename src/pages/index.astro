  <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold pb-10">Hello.</h1>
  <article class="text-xl space-y-4 leading-relaxed">
    <p>
      As a multi-disciplinary creator, I focus on the intersections of
      technology, art, and collaboration. Today, I focus on designing software
      to facilitate connecting people through their ideas and thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      I studied computer science at the University of Virginia where I earned
      High Distinctions for my machine learning work. Later, I would focus on
      healthcare interoperability at Epic and then building my own startups.
    </p>
    <p>
      This will be the home for sharing my projects, written work, and research.
      At some point, I plan to organize this as a newsletter.
