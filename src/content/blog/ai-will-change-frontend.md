Notes
- JS has always been product focused -- netscape, google earth, etc
- TS has gone beyond static typed languages like Go and Java, the inference guides us
- Devs like a good DX, maybe at the expense of good UX sometimes. We will want to use TS everywhere including mobile
- RSC -> APIs can send html
- Contextual AI will replace frontend. 
	- New companies reaching a conclusion for app-less hardware (e.g. Rabbit R1, Humane AI pin)
	- e.g. instead of a dating app that a user signs up for and fills in their profile, an AI that really knows the user can generate an entire profile of the user and display that to other users who want to date
	- Globe Discovery engine generated UI
- Future: AI partner (like Her) that really knows users and can generate UIs. Backend devs will work instead on creating more API that an AI can interact with, front end devs will create react components that the API can return which the AI renders.
	- More lego piece development
- "LLMs are powerful tools, but they shouldn't be the UI."
- "Our interfaces should be richer, not minimal. Less text, more whiteboard."
