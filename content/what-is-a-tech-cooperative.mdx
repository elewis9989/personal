# What's a Cooperative?

While there are many ways to build a cooperative (co-op) in practice, there are two common requirements for a business to be considered a cooperative:
1. Owned by workers of the business
2. Controlled democratically by the workers


You might be familiar with corporations that are owned by shareholders. Workers of that company may possibly own some shares but not nearly enough compared to the CEO and other executives even if they work just as much. They do not have voting stocks to actually participate in executive decisions for the company they work for. In this context, it is not truly worker-owned.

In a worker co-op, the workers own the business equally which means everyone has an equal say in how the business is run and profit is shared in an equitable way. This does not mean everyone gets the same amount of money &mdash; salaries could be different and the number of hours worked could be different so there may be a collective agreement as to how profit is distributed.

If Apple were organized as a cooperative, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/cameronkeng/2014/12/18/if-apple-was-a-worker-cooperative-each-employee-would-earn-at-least-403k/?sh=7b194ba22dee" alt="Forbes article citation" target="_blank">all workers would earn $400K yearly <em>on top of their salary</em></a>.

Essentially, while traditional businesses scale vertically and form stricter hierarchies, cooperative businesses scale horizontally and remain democratic.


# Why Don't More Cooperatives Exist?

There is a dearth of documentation when it comes to starting a co-op and what does exist primarily is for the agricultural industry. The model is however more popular in other places of the world, so perhaps there are ideas we can borrow.

Introducing democracy also has never been popular as it goes against what is commonplace. Most common folk believed the king had the divine right to rule, so introducing the ideas of democratically elected leaders was nonsensical radicalism. Likewise, tell workers today that they should own the business they work for, and they may very well argue on behalf of their bosses. We live in a world where an Armani fashion designer can create the clothes the company sells, but not be able to actually afford what they created. This has been accepted as normal.

Nevertheless, there are some cooperatives in the tech space already: check out this <a href="https://github.com/hng/tech-coops#coops-namerica" alt="List of tech cooperatives" target="_blank">repository</a>.


# Why Does Tech Need Cooperatives?

A software engineer may be content with their six-figure salary. But consider how the software that they write which the company uses to sell for profit earns millions (maybe billions), yet the millions of dollars are not distributed to the ones who created the software but the vast majority is instead given to the executives of the company. The engineer probably is only given a "bonus" at the end of the year for their hard work. It may be that given the average engineer makes more than the average American, they do not protest but it does not change the fact that this is opposed to democracy. It is an outdated model that should be deprecated. 

Unions have emerged, <a href="https://alphabetworkersunion.org/principles/history/" alt="Alphabet Union Website" target="_blank">such as for Google</a>, to argue on behalf of the workers. But in a cooperative model, unions aren't needed as workers already control the company.


If Facebook were a cooperative, would Cambridge Analytica have been able to use the data of 87 million users without their consent? As workers control the company, they would have a say in the ethics of the company rather than a small few executives. 

As more tech co-ops are made, they could form alliances with one another and help other workplaces organize horizontally. The cooperative model could spread to other industries uplifting the working class.
