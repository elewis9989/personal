# What's a Cooperative?

You might be familiar with corporations that are owned by shareholders. Workers of that company may possibly own some shares but not nearly enough compared to the CEO and other executives even if they work just as much. They do not have voting shares to actually participate in executive decisions for the company they work for. In this context, it is not truly worker-owned.

A cooperative (co-op) deviates from the traditional model in two ways:
1. Owned by workers of the business
2. Controlled democratically by the workers

The degree to which these conditions are met do vary and there isn't a single correct way to make a co-op. 

Generally though, in a worker co-op, the workers own the business equally. This often means everyone has a say in how the business is run and profit is shared in an equitable way. This does not mean that voting rights are always uniform nor does it mean everyone gets the same amount of money &mdash; salaries could be different and the number of hours worked could be different so there may be a collective agreement as to how profit is distributed. 

If Apple were organized as a cooperative, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/cameronkeng/2014/12/18/if-apple-was-a-worker-cooperative-each-employee-would-earn-at-least-403k/?sh=7b194ba22dee" alt="Forbes article citation" target="_blank">all workers would earn $400K yearly <em>on top of their salary</em></a>.

Essentially, while traditional businesses scale vertically and form stricter hierarchies, cooperative businesses typically scale horizontally and remain democratic. Leaders work for the workers rather than the reverse.

# How Do Cooperatives Make Decisions?

If every worker owns the business, how then are decisions made? It would certainly be cumbersome to vote on every company decision especially as it grows larger. 

Co-ops are flexible though and each one may practice different types of methods. Smaller co-ops may have workers making decisions together through frameworks like <a href="https://youtu.be/DYKwn9jzjXs" alt="Dean Spade: Basic Steps in Consensus Decision Making" target="_blank">consensus-decision making</a>. Other co-ops may see benefit in electing leaders including electing the CEO with term limits and veto power. 

The Mondragon Corporation in Spain is the <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/how-mondragon-became-the-worlds-largest-co-op" alt="How Mondragon Became the World’s Largest Co-Op" target="_blank">world's largest co-op</a>. It is a federation of worker-owned cooperatives with over 80,000 workers across multiple industries. Workers elect a governing council who then elect the CEO. It's been around since 1956.

# Why Don't More Cooperatives Exist in the US?

There are many co-ops in other countries and many are long-standing such as Mondragon in Spain, John Lewis Partnership in the UK, and Coop in Italy.

In the US however, there is a dearth of documentation when it comes to starting a co-op and what does exist primarily is for the agricultural industry. 

There are a few reasons for the lack of co-ops in the US. The US has had a stronger emphasis on traditional, investor-owned businesses. The legal and regulatory environment in the US has not always been supportive of cooperative businesses. Startup culture in the tech industry often prioritizes rapid growth and exit strategies, which may not align with the long-term sustainability and community-focused values of many cooperatives.

That being said, there are some successful cooperatives in the tech space already: check out this <a href="https://github.com/hng/tech-coops#coops-namerica" alt="List of tech cooperatives" target="_blank">repository</a>.


# Why Does Tech Need Cooperatives?

A software engineer may be content with their six-figure salary today, but consider how the software that they write which the company uses to sell for profit earns millions (maybe billions). Yet the millions of dollars are not distributed to the ones who created the software but the vast majority is instead given to the executives of the company. The engineer probably is only given a "bonus" at the end of the year for their hard work. It may be that given the average engineer makes more than the average American, they do not protest but it does not change the fact that this is opposed to democracy. It is an outdated model that should be deprecated. 

If Facebook were a cooperative, would Cambridge Analytica have been able to use the data of 87 million users without their consent? As workers control the company, they would have a say in the ethics of the company rather than a small few executives. 

As more tech co-ops are made, they could form alliances with one another and help other workplaces organize horizontally. The cooperative model could spread to other industries uplifting the working class.

Cooperatives are already a proven model in many industries around the world and they're a viable alternative to the traditional startup model. It is time to extend what already works and what is clearly better to the US tech industry.
